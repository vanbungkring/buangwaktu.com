<p>The Version of Credit Score or Credit Report you have may be outdated.  Every month, your credit score can change, based on your activities.  If you have activities that you&#8217;re not aware whether it is building or hurting your credit score, you really should think about how you&#8217;re going to have access to a regular credit report that shows your where your score is headed.  So much data will be listed on your credit report that enables you to then make decisions what you can make purchases and be extended money.  A Good Credit Score or an Excellent Credit Score works, but which are you aiming for?</p>

    <div class="article"><p>Choosing a <b>cellphone</b> and <b>cellphone plan</b> that works for you is one of the most important decisions you can make. Most cellphone providers like to lock customers into a two year contract, this means that picking the right carrier from the start is critical. Each cellphone provider offers a different selection of phones and services. One of the most important pieces of information you need to look at as a consumer is which OS version each phone and carrier provides. Right now <b>Droid phones</b> are very popular however there are different versions of the operating system and it&#8217;s important to understand the nuances between each version before buying the phone.</p>
<p>The Android os was released on September 23rd of 2008, version 1.1 followed in February of 2009. Since then Android has had four different software versions, 1.5, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.2. The latest version of Android is version 2.3 codenamed Gingerbread. <b>Android Gingerbread</b> was released on December 6th, 2010 and included an updated user interface, native support for SIP VOIP telephony, and a dozen other new features. There are two other known versions of Android in the works, Honeycomb, which will be released in early 2011 and Ice Cream which is speculated to launch in mid 2011.</p>
<p>If you want to see the latest version of Android in action then take a look at the video below:</p>
<p>Along with cellular phone service many of the top carriers also offer <b>High Speed Internet</b>. In many cases you can get your internet service bundled with your telephone and other services for a reduced rate. When signing-up for Internet service you&#8217;ll want to make sure to pick a plan and provider that&#8217;s the best fit for you. Just like cellphone providers many <b>Internet Services</b> provide discounted rates for customers that sign-up for a contract period of one year or more.</p>
<p>Internet services providers offer different versions of their services. These usually start with a low-bandwidth version that also offers significant cost-savings. While this might be fine for checking email many will find this too slow to stream music or videos. The next version of Internet Service usually involves a fast connections around 3 MBPS or more. The third version of tier of service offered by an Internet provider is usually geared towards businesses that need to upload and download large amounts of data.</p>
<p>At Version.com we can help you sort through all the confusion software versions to understand exactly what cellphone you need and which cellphone provider best meets your needs.</p>

    <div class="article"><h1><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal;">When you buy a new cellphone what’s the first thing you usually do? Set the ringtone. Well now that most cellphones can download ringtones from the Internet it is easier than ever to have a <b>custom ringtone</b> on your phone. You can download ringtones online either directly through your cellular phone or by using a popular ringtone download site.</span></h1>
<p>You can find plenty of free ringtones online by simply visiting your favorite search engine and entering, “free ringtones for <i>your phone</i>” where <i>your phone</i> is your phone make and model. You can also buy ringtones online or directly from your phone, these are usually snippets of popular songs that are then looped and turned-into a ringtone.</p>
<p>Making your own ringtone is a great way to save money while enjoying a completely unqiue ringtone. The best way to make you own ringtone is to either download an app for your iPhone or Droid phone, or use a piece of audio recording software on your computer. If you make the ringtone on your computer make sure that you are using the correct format for your cellphone.</p>

At Version.com we know that every provider offers a different version of their service geared at a specific user type. To help you better determine which is the best fit for you take a look at the list below and see what kind of Internet user you are.</span></h1>
<div>
<p><b>Basic Broadband</b><br />
You do mostly email and some light web browsing on your computer. You don’t stream music or videos and aren’t concerned if playback is choppy, price is your top concern.</p>
<p><b>Intermediate Broadband</b><br />
You do email, web browsing and enjoy streaming music and videos. The Intermediate version of an Internet Provider’s plan is where most people end-up as it offers a speed that allows you to use the Internet to its full potential.</p>
<p><b>Business Broadband</b><br />
You run a business and need to have multiple computers all doing email, browsing the web and potentially streaming music and videos. High Speed Internet for business used to be very expensive but now you can get great speeds usually for under $100/month.</p>
